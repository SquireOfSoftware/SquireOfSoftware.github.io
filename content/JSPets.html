In it&#x27;s current state it is about 75% done.</p><p>Originally it was to hook into the pedometer so that your pet could walk with you as you walked. But that never got done.</p><p>But as it currently stands, you can tap the screen to walk your pet, and each town/city has a mini-boss that your pet will have to battle. And at the very end at Port Arthur, you will face off a really cool end boss.</p><h3 class="Page_sticky_heading__yLneF">What is this made of?</h3><p>It is a 20 by 45 canvas, using the browser animation frames for 60 fps, an infinite game loop with hand crafted state objects, and hand drawn MSPaint sprites.</p><p>There are idle sprites, there are walking sprites, there were damage sprites, evolution sprites, environment sprites, wild life sprites.</p><img class="JSPets_image__qlSMD JSPets_pixelated__yCZOH" src="/images/jspets/duck.png"/><p>Above you can see 3 levels of sprite states, the first is the &quot;basic&quot; baby animal state, and if you wanted to you can &quot;evolve&quot; your pet to stronger versions of itself (which would push the sprite pointer down one level, a max of three levels) and so you can survive longer.</p><p>I have rerigged the sprite and state transitions below, so have a go at mousing over them and watch them animate.</p><div class="JSPets_sprite_map_container__OaVL4"><div class="JSPets_duckling__Id_4f"></div><div class="JSPets_older_duckling__6tnvt"></div><div class="JSPets_duck__REMd4"></div></div><p>In fact the longest part of this project was the actual generation of the sprites, they took about three months to make.</p><p>Here is a quick gif compilation of all the types of sprites that I drew up for the game:</p><img class="JSPets_image__qlSMD" src="/images/jspets/demo.gif"/><h3 class="Page_sticky_heading__yLneF">What is the game about?</h3><p>The game really is about walking to Port Arthur (bottom right) from Redpa (top left).</p><img class="JSPets_image__qlSMD JSPets_restricted_image__G49Sg" src="/images/jspets/tasmania.png"/><p>And here is the map translated into a pixel map of about 45 by 40 pixels</p><img class="JSPets_image__qlSMD JSPets_pixelated__yCZOH JSPets_restricted_image__G49Sg" src="/images/jspets/tasmania-45by40 with cities.png"/><p>And you tap the screen to walk your little pet around Tasmania.</p><p>This was a really good project because I had to work within the 20 by 45 pixel limitation, and it was precisely because of this limitation I had to make some very challenging creative decisions, regarding how to express movement in a very limited space, how to express game progress and how to randomly generate enemies to fight, as well a little bit of performance tuning (understanding the dev tools throttling mechanism, understanding how to unpack the most expensive calls, even though the images that I was drawing were tiny, some of the animations and transitions could seriously kill the performance).</p><p>I also learnt an incredible amount about Tasmania, as each city had an overlap of biomes and climate like beaches or mountainous areas or forestry or urban cities, which I used to spawn enemies that were specific to the different biomes and climates...like a finding a rare and endangered fridge on Cradle mountain.</p><div class="JSPets_sprite_map_container__OaVL4"><div class="JSPets_fridge__XqmAV JSPets_sprite__uqlgO"></div></div><p>For the full demo of the JSPets project, you can access it<!-- --> <a href="https://squireofsoftware.github.io/JSPets/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>For the source code, you can access it<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/SquireOfSoftware/JSPets" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/content/JSPets","query":{},"buildId":"Vln28knUHoXqiB6dpXqxR","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
