# SquireOfSoftware.github.io
A test website to prove to myself that I could recreate the same look
as Facebook Messenger at around 2017 with just CSS.

The website just displays all the work that I have done from uni as
well as a few extra things that I have done on the side.

This is now archived as of the 17th of October, 2021, as I seek to update
this site to look a little nicer.
